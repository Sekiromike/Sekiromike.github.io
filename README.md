<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Rushath 👋</h1>

<p align="center">
  I like building things that sit at the intersection of <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Biology</strong>.  
  Mostly because I genuinely believe this space can change how we understand health, disease, and life itself.

## 🌱 A little about me
I’m someone who enjoys:
- working on ML ideas that make me pause and think  
- learning algorithms and writing clean notes  
- exploring how biological systems can be understood through computation  
- building small projects that slowly grow into meaningful work  

I love the feeling of going from  
➡️ “this is confusing”  
to  
➡️ “wait… *this actually works*.”

## 🧬 Why Computational Biology matters to me
I want to work on things that can push humanity forward — getting there.. one step at a time.

Using ML to:
- understand genes  
- model biological processes  
- discover patterns we can’t see  
- help diagnose or solve rare-disease problems  

feels like a way to contribute to something bigger than myself.  
It’s the kind of work that makes me excited to wake up and learn more.
